# Build-Explain-a-Simple-Blockchain
Understand blockchain fundamentals, block structure, and consensus mechanisms by simulating a mini blockchain and explaining how it works — both technically and conceptually.
Mini Task 1

Theoretical Part:
Blockchain Basics
1. Define blockchain in your own words (100–150 words).

Ans: Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that securely records data across a network of computers in a series of connected blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions and is linked to the previous block through a cryptographic hash, creating a chain that is nearly tamper-proof. Because the data is stored across multiple nodes (computers) and consensus mechanisms are used to validate new entries, it is decentralized and resistant to fraud. Once data is recorded in a block and added to the chain, it cannot be changed without altering all subsequent blocks, making it highly secure and transparent. Blockchain is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but has many other applications due to its integrity, trust, and automation capabilities.

2. List 2 real-life use cases (e.g., supply chain, digital identity).

Ans: Supply Chain Management: Blockchain is used to track the movement of goods from origin to destination, ensuring transparency and authenticity (e.g., IBM Food Trust).

Digital Identity: It allows individuals to own and control their identity data securely and share it only when necessary (e.g., SelfKey or uPort).

Block Anatomy
3. Draw a block showing: data, previous hash, timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root.

+-------------------------------------------------+
|                 Block Structure                 |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Timestamp:       2025-06-08 10:00:00            |
| Previous Hash:   00000a34b45c9...               |
| Nonce:           293847                         |
| Merkle Root:     4a8f0a9de19d23a...             |
|                                                 |
| Data:                                          |
|  - Tx1: Alice → Bob (2 BTC)                    |
|  - Tx2: Bob → Charlie (1 BTC)                  |
|  - Tx3: Charlie → Dave (0.5 BTC)               |
+-------------------------------------------------+

4. Briefly explain with an example how the Merkle root helps verify data integrity.

Ans: The Merkle root is a single hash that represents all transactions in a block. It's derived by hashing pairs of transaction hashes repeatedly until one root hash remains.
Example: If a single transaction changes (e.g., Alice sends 3 BTC instead of 2 BTC), the hash of that transaction changes, and so does every parent hash up the tree, ultimately altering the Merkle root. This makes tampering detectable instantly and helps ensure that the data hasn’t been modified.
Consensus Conceptualization
6. What is Proof of Work and why does it require energy?

Ans: Proof of Work is a consensus mechanism where miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate and add new blocks to the blockchain. This process requires significant computational power and energy because the puzzle (usually finding a hash with a specific number of leading zeros) involves trial and error. It ensures security and prevents attacks by making it costly and difficult to alter any block. Bitcoin uses PoW.
7. What is Proof of Stake and how does it differ?
Ans: Proof of Stake selects validators to create new blocks based on the number of tokens they “stake” or lock up as collateral. Instead of using computational power, PoS depends on economic incentives—validators risk losing their stake if they validate malicious transactions. This method is energy-efficient compared to PoW and is used in blockchains like Ethereum 2.0 and Cardano.
8. What is Delegated Proof of Stake and how are validators selected?

Ans: In DPoS, token holders vote to elect a small number of delegates or validators who are responsible for validating transactions and producing blocks. The voting power is proportional to the amount of cryptocurrency one holds. Validators can be replaced through ongoing voting, making the system more democratic and faster but also slightly more centralized. DPoS is used in platforms like EOS and TRON.

Practical Part (Code-Based Tasks)

1. Block Simulation in Code
Objective: Build a basic blockchain with 3 linked blocks using code.
 Task:
Create a Block class with:

index, timestamp, data, previousHash, hash, and nonce

Implement a simple hash generator using SHA-256

Link 3 blocks by chaining their previousHash

Display all blocks with their hashes

 Challenge:
Change the data of Block 1 and recalculate its hash.

Observe how all following blocks become invalid unless hashes are recomputed.

 Goal: Understand how tampering one block affects the entire chain.

2. Nonce Mining Simulation
Objective: Simulate Proof-of-Work by mining a block that satisfies a difficulty condition.
 Task:
Modify your Block class to include a mineBlock(difficulty) function

Set difficulty (e.g., hash must start with "0000")

In mineBlock(), repeatedly increment the nonce until the hash meets the difficulty condition

 Output:
Print how many nonce attempts were needed

Measure time taken using a timer

Goal: Experience how computational effort increases with difficulty

3. Consensus Mechanism Simulation
Objective: Simulate and compare PoW, PoS, and DPoS logic in code.
 Task:
Create mock objects for 3 validators:

miner = {power: random value} for PoW

staker = {stake: random value} for PoS

voters = [3 mock accounts voting] for DPoS

 Simulate:
For PoW: Select validator with highest power

For PoS: Select validator with highest stake

For DPoS: Randomly choose a delegate based on most votes

 Output:
Print selected validator and consensus method used

Include a console.log explanation of the selection logic

 Goal: Compare decision-making in various consensus mechanisms
